Cocos Creator's in-editor scene view and web runtime share the same framework, which is the content of this repo. It's originally forked from [Cocos2d-html5](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5/), we build up an Entity Component architecture on it to meet the needs of Cocos Creator. 

This framework is a cross-platform game engine written in Javascript and licensed under MIT. It supports major desktop and mobile browsers, it's also compatible with Cocos2d Javascript Binding engine to support native platforms like iOS, Android, Win32, Mac OS X.
