/**
 * The class to which this annotation is applied is not thread-safe.
 * This annotation primarily exists for clarifying the non-thread-safety of a class
 * that might otherwise be assumed to be thread-safe, despite the fact that it is a bad
 * idea to assume a class is thread-safe without good reason.
 * @see ThreadSafe
 * <p>
 * Based on code developed by Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls and concepts
 * published in 'Java Concurrency in Practice' by Brian Goetz, Tim Peierls,
 * Joshua Bloch, Joseph Bowbeer, David Holmes and Doug Lea.
