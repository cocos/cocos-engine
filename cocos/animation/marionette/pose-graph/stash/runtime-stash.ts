 *
 * - Stash records are created at the beginning of layer instantiation, before instantiation of any other things.
 *   All records' initial states are `UNINITIALIZED`.
 *
 * - Each stash is fed into the record, cause the record's state transition into `UNSETTLED`.
 *   Then the stash's graph starts its bind stage.
 *
 * - After all things in animation graph completed their bind stage, each stash would be settled.
 *   Then the stash was put in `SETTLED` state.
 *
 * - For each animation graph tick:
 *
 *   - If the stash was not accessed in last tick(asserts its state would be `SETTLED`),
 *     but should be accessed in this tick. The stash would call `reenter()` of its graph.
 *     Then the stash was put in `PENDING` state.
 *
 *   - Then, the stash will run into `UPDATING` and then `UPDATED` stage in animation graph update stage.
 *     The stash only updates once, if there're multiple update threads, the later update takes no effect.
 *     If circular dependency occurred, the update as well takes no effect.
 *
 *   - Then, the stash will run into `EVALUATING` and then `EVALUATED` stage in animation graph evaluation stage.
 *     The stash only evaluates once and the evaluation result is cached,
 *     if there're multiple evaluation threads, the evaluation result is duplicated.
 *     If circular dependency occurred, the evaluation returns default pose.
 *
 *   - At the end of tick,
 *
 *      - If the stash is not updated and is not evaluated in this tick, it will be put back into `SETTLED` stage.
 *
 *      - Otherwise, it will be put in `PENDING` state.
