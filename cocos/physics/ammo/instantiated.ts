 * ```ts
 * import Ammo from '@cocos/ammo';
 * const v = Ammo.btVector3(); // Error: Ammo is not instantiated!
 * ```
 *
 * That's why this module comes ---
 * The default export `Ammo` from this module has the meaning:

 * With the stage 3 proposal "top level await",

 * It guarantees the promise `waitForAmmoInstantiation()`
 * is resolved before this module finished its execution.
 * But this technique is rarely implemented for now and can not be implemented in CommonJS.
 * We have to expose this waiting function to beg for earlier invocation by the external.
 * In Cocos Creator Editor's implementation,
 * it awaits for the:
 * ```ts
 * import thisFunction from 'cc.wait-for-ammo-instantiated';
 * await thisFunction();
 * ```
 * before `'cc.physics-ammo'` can be imported;
 * @param wasmBinary The .wasm file, if any.(In wechat, this is the path of wasm file.)
