- [ ] If your pull request has gone "stale", you should **rebase** your work on top of the latest version of the upstream branch.
- [ ] If your commit history is full of small, unimportant commits (such as "fix pep8" or "update tests"), **squash** your commits down to a few, or one, discreet changesets before submitting a pull request.
- [ ] Document new code with comments in source code based on API docs
- [ ] Make sure any runtime log information in `log` , `error` or `new Error('')` has been moved into `EngineErrorMap.md` with an ID, and use `logID(id)` or `new Error(getError(id))` instead.
